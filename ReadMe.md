You are to build QUIZ NOW, a quiz application that pulls questions from a database and presents it to the user, who can answer the questions using radio buttons or checkboxes. At the end of the quiz, the user can see their total score.
Deliverables:
1. User should be able to enter their name before they are allowed to take the quiz
2. User should be presented 10 questions in order 
3. Questions should be selected from the bag randomly.
4. User should click a "Next" button to go to the next question, and a "Previous" Button to return to the previous question
5. There should be a high score page where user can see their highscores (with name) and the date and time the scores were attained
6. User should be able to close the window and come back and see their highscores (data should persist)
